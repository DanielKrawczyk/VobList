# VobList

Here is a totally useless page for all users, unless you are using Zengin Engine. I made it just to help myself work faster as a level-designer. The most important thing for me was to quickly find the code and copy it with just one click. I also managed to write a simple node server to add new assets and delete the others.

Important note: In order to use 100% of the app you need to run a server available in "NodeServer" folder on local port 3333!
